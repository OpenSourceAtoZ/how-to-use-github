# Open Source First Presentation

We talk about Mobile or API first, why not Open Source First. What does this mean? It means you must think about the wider audience first and not just your private needs.

For example:
* The README must contain Installation instructions
* Each commit message must be descriptive
* Each committed files must be related to that commit
* Secure information must not be committed 
* De-coupled Architecture
